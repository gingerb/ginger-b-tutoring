        <p>
          In order to complete the personal responses required for the scrapbooks, each
          student will need to complete all of the WebQuests available on this website.  Each
          page here constitutes a single WebQuest.  You can see the topics by clicking on
          the WebQuests menu at the top of this page.
        </p>

        <strong>What you need to do:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>Choose a topic.</li>
          <li>Go to that topic's page and explore the resources provided.</li>
          <li>Complete a personal response using the information from the web resources you explored and any questions provided at the bottom of the topic's page.  (These are only to spark ideas!  You are not required to directly answer the questions in your response.)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Your personal responses will be graded based on the Personal Responses section
          in <a href="pdfs/ScrapbookRubric.pdf">this rubric for your scrapbook.</a>  There is no specific format for the responses,
          nor a specific question to be answered; but the idea is for whatever you do to
          fit on a single 8.5" x 11" page that can be inserted on the back of each scrapbook
          page in your book.  <b>Your job is to demonstrate that you explored the resources and
          learned something.</b>  Below are some ideas for personal responses, but others are welcome!
          If you have another idea, talk to me about it.
        </p>

        <strong>Written:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>1-page summary of what you read about</li>
          <li>1-page response to what you read: What did it make you think about?  What is something you learned from it?  Did it change your perspective on the topic?  Did it spark a new interest, or answer a question you had?</li>
          <li>An article for others on the topic</li>
          <li>Compare an event to something that's happening today</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Visual:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Magazine cover with the topic as the cover story</li>
          <li>Original art: draw someone discussed in the WebQuest, something you pictured in your head as you read, an event that took place, etc.</li>
          <li>Create a comic strip that illustrates a series of events discussed, or the life of a person discussed</li>
          <li>Create a collage with clippings from magazines, newspapers, etc.</li>
        </ul>
